In the file marie.py, you will find this string:

student = "00678, Marie Moreau, Lamplighter School of Crime-fighting, Godolkin"

where:
	"00678", is the student ID
	"Marie Moreau", is the student's first and last name respectively
	"Lamplighter School of Crimefighting", is the student's college, and
	"Godolkin", is the student's university.


You will also find this dictionary
(you are not allowed to change the contents of this dictionary in any way):

student = {
	"00678": {
		"first_name": first_name,
		"last_name": last_name,
		"university": uni,
		"college": college,
	}
}

The dictionary has one item whose key is "00678", and whose value is yet another dictionary
with keys and values of its own. This one item is an alternative representation of the same student
we saw earlier in the string.


============= YOUR TASK ============

Add python code to your marie.py file such that when the program runs, 
the output looks something like this:

{'00678': {'college': 'Godolkin',
           'first_name': '00678',
           'last_name': 'Marie Moreau',
           'university': 'Lamplighter School of Crime-fighting'}}

In particular, the values first_name, last_name, uni and college have been replaced
with the correct information from the string representation.


==== Your limitations when solving this problem ====
You can only add code in between the "# > Only add code below this line" line and
the "# > Only add code above this line" line. 
In other words, touch nothing else inside the file.


==== Things to think about ====
1) What we are actually doing here is taking the string, and breaking it up 
into parts ...somehow, so we can later feed those parts into the dictionary.

2) You may also need to keep track of those parts for the program to work correctly.
